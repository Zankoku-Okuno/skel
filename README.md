# skel

Script to manage skeleton files/directories using little more than a simple filesystem.

## Install

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edemko/skel/master/skel.sh -O ~/bin/skel
```

## Usage

Skeleton files/folders are stored in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/skel`.
The first level of directories in this folder are called "packages".
All the files and folders under a package are valid templates.

  * `skel list`: List all packages, one per line.
  * `skel list <PKG>`: List all valid templates from the given package, one per line.
  * `skel mk <PKG> <TEMPLATE PATH>`: Copy a template (unchanged) into the present working directory.
  * `skel mk <PKG>`: The default template is stored under `<PKG>/default`.
  * `skel read <PKG>`: Search the present working directory (and all sub-directories) for template holes.
    Then, prompt the user at the commandline for values for each hole.

## Template Language

Both file contents and file _names_ can be have template holes.
A template hole takes one of two forms:

  * `@@@`varname`@@@`: where the varname can be any non-empty sequence of characters i n`A-Z0-9_`.
  * `@@@`varname`=$(`bash command`)@@@`: the default value is generated by the bash command (e.g. `date +'%Y'`).

For security, shell commands are not executed until the user submits an empty line in response to a prompt.
